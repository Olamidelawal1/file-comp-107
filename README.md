This is a site that can be used to compare excel files. A user can upload two excel files and different options can be selected and it is described below.

How it works

When your two files have been uploaded:

# 1. Highlight duplicates and return a single file (Highlighted File): 

At this endpoint, when a user clicks the button that performs this action, their files will be analyzed for any duplicates, which will be highlighted and our system will save a copy of their highlighted excel file to the database, which they can download at a later date or immediately. 

# 2. Remove duplicates, return single file (Clean file): 

At this endpoint, when a user clicks the button that performs this action, their files will be analyzed for any duplicates, which will be removed and our system will save a copy of their clean excel file to the database, which they can download at a later date or immediately. 

# 3. Highlight duplicates, return two files (Original and highlighted files): 

At this endpoint, when a user clicks the button that performs this action, their files will be analyzed for any duplicates, which will be highlighted and our system will save a copy of their highlighted and original excel files to the database, which they can download at a later date or immediately. 

# 4. Remove  duplicates, return two files (Clean and highlighted files): 

At this endpoint, when a user clicks the button that performs this action, their files will be analyzed for any duplicates, which will be removed and our system will save a copy of their highlighted and original excel files to the database, which they can download at a later date or immediately.
